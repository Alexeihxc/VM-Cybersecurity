# VM-Cybersecurity

This repository contains my personal writeups, walkthroughs, and notes for vulnerable machines and cybersecurity challenges, primarily from **TryHackMe**.

It serves both as a learning journal and as a reference for tools, techniques, and methodologies used during penetration testing and CTF practice.
